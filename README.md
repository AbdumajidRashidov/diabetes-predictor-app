## Diabetes Predictor
> Predict Diabetes using Machine Learning.

In this project, our objective is to predict whether the patient has diabetes or not based on various features like *Glucose level, Insulin, Age, BMI*. We will perform all the steps from *Data gathering to Model deployment.* During Model evaluation, we compare various machine learning algorithms on the basis of accuracy_score metric and find the best one. Then we create a web app using Flask which is a python micro framework.
